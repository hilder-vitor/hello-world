# Laboratory of Security and Cryptography (LASCA): securing computation

Starting from 2012, LCA (Laboratory of Applied Cryptography) and LAS (Laboratory of Systems Administration and Security) merged into the 
Laboratory of Security and Cryptography (LASCA), at the Institute of Computing (IC) of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). 
Research topics include, among others, malware behavior analysis, cloud security, vulnerability analysis, 
efficient and secure implementation of cryptographic applications, electronic voting, and computing on encrypted data.
